                  <p>One of the best things about Citron is that it is easy to use. It makes canvas easier to understand without the annoying chaining of functions. It's also extremely lightweight.</p>
                  <h2>How Much Experience Do I Need?</h2>
                  <p>You don't really need that much experience in programming to thoroughly use citron. The docs will give you a complete less on how to use citron. But, since making shapes and scaling is geometry, you will need to have some experience in math, to be able to understand some of the properties in the constructors. Mainly citron uses x and y parameters to scale, that is quite easy for for some people to understand. If you are not so good at math, you may want to learn more geometry before you start using Citron.</p>
